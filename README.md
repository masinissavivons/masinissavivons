 # Hi there. #

With a background in Sociology and Product/Marketing, I shifted to programming.
I see the three of them as very complementary, giving me the ability to understand from a functional/product point of the view the necessity of a feature, and its
doeability as a programmer.

Frontend or backend? Both I'd say. This gives me the ability to get the big picture and see what does what and why, giving more sense, life, to the lines of code
I'll write.


**ðŸ“šMy current stack:**
- Front-end: HTML5 / CSS3 / JS Vanilla / jQuery / Bootstrap / React / Redux / Socket.io
- Backend: NodeJs / Express
- Mobile: React Native
- Database: Mongo DB
- Workflow: Git / GitHub
- Process: TDD (Jest)
- Architecture: MVC
